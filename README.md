# Neural_Style_Transfer
The scripts here are for the state of the art **Neural Style Transfer**, basing on the **VGG-19** model. Before going to the details inside, there are two important issues need to be mentioned here.  

The first thing is regarding to the **VGG-19** model data. Since the size of the pre-trained model data is already 510 MB, which is too large to upload into Github. Therefore, I upload this pre-trained model data into a Google drive, whose link is [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RWcXJdjwNJ57wL-XfWZiC-ermIlDc1_8?usp=sharing]. The name of the file is 'imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat',
